 *     require("../shared/util")
 *     require("@name/path")       through an alias registered with addAlias()
 *     require("@name")
 *
 * A path P resolves to P.luau, or P/init.luau if that doesn't exist. If both
 * exist the require is an error. Anything not starting with "./", "../" or "@"
 * is rejected (this keeps bare names free for a future package mechanism).
 *
 * WHERE "@name" POINTS
 *
 * The alias is looked up in this order:
 *
 *   1. Aliases registered with addAlias(). These always win, so anything that
 *      resolved before still resolves to the same place.
 *   2. The dependencies declared in the manifest (.sonata/project.luau) of the
 *      package that contains the requiring file, i.e. the nearest folder above
 *      it that has a .sonata/project.luau. The dependency is looked up in the
 *      flat deps folder (see package.hpp): next to the package if the package
 *      itself sits in a .sonata/deps folder, otherwise in its own .sonata/deps.
 *
 * (2) means a dependency can require the packages its own manifest lists even
 * if the root project's manifest doesn't mention them, and without anyone
 * having to register an alias for them. Which manifest applies depends on the
 * file doing the require, not on the file being required. Packages are not
 * isolated from each other: a name that is registered (1) is visible
 * everywhere, and since everything is installed flat, a name always means the
 * same folder no matter who asks. How manifests are read is up to the
 * ModuleSource (see dependencyNames()).
 *
 * A module runs once per VM, on its own sandboxed thread, and must return
 * exactly one non-nil value. That value is cached and returned by every later
 * require of the same file. Cyclic requires are reported as errors.
 *
 * LIFETIME: install() gives the VM a raw pointer to this object, so the loader
 * must outlive every piece of Lua code that can run, and must not be moved.
 * Use one loader per VM, and declare it before the VM.
